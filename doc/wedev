How to change default gateway:

For Linux,
Note: It could not add a new default gateway on Linux, it will need to delete the old one and add new one.  Please backup the old gateway information for restore.
ip route delete default via <old gateway ip> dev <interface>
ip route add default via 10.10.0.1 dev netmaker

Restore:
ip route delete default via 10.10.0.1 dev netmaker
ip route add default via <old gateway ip> dev <interface>


For Windows,

netsh int ipv4 add route 0.0.0.0/0 interface=netmaker nexthop=10.10.0.1 store=active metric=1

Restore:
netsh int ipv4 delete route 0.0.0.0/0 interface=netmaker nexthop=10.10.0.1 store=active
